 tech_enigmatic_code_creation: "Secret Code"
 tech_enigmatic_code_creation_desc: "We're going to create a hard-to-solve cryptosystem—and, of course, maybe some windfall." 
 tech_enigmatic_code_creation_effect: "Gain access to research §Y$tech_enigmatic_encoder$§! and §Y$tech_enigmatic_decoder$§!." 
 sic_mod.171.name: "$tech_enigmatic_code_creation$"
 sic_mod.171.desc: "As technology has advanced by leaps and bounds, so has our encryption capabilities.\nBut that's still not enough.\nWe need to develop a cryptosystem that can be widely used in space operations to ensure that we are in a good position in battle. Of course, this process requires an incredible amount of scientific research capacity."
 sic_mod.172.name: "$tech_enigmatic_code_creation$"
 sic_mod.172.desc: "It's done. We have invented a system of ciphers that is completely incomprehensible to ordinary people, and in the process has greatly improved our own ability to crack them. And now, the last step we need to do is to make a more complex device that carries the system, and then apply it to the ship."
 sic_mod.173.name: "$tech_enigmatic_code_creation$"
 sic_mod.173.desc: "It's embarrassing that the cryptosystem we're currently working on bears a striking resemblance to one we've recently discovered... It seems that we do not need to continue to spend time on this."
 tech_rebirth_from_the_church: "Immortal Materials"
 tech_rebirth_from_the_church_desc: "We'll be looking for ways to survive the Big Crunch—and, of course, maybe with some windfalls." 
 tech_rebirth_from_the_church_effect: "Gain the opportunity to research §Y$tech_dragon_armor$§!." 
 sic_mod.174.name: "$tech_rebirth_from_the_church$"
 sic_mod.174.desc: "Long before stepping into the stars, our scientists have always had a question: Is there a way for us to survive the inevitable "Big Crunch" of the universe? Now, we have been able to extrapolate this seemingly non-existent possibility for ourselves by building a complex model. Of course, this process requires an incredible amount of scientific research capacity."
 sic_mod.175.name: "$tech_rebirth_from_the_church$"
 sic_mod.175.desc: "After a long period of research, our scientists were pleasantly surprised to discover that it is entirely possible to emerge from the Big Crunch. They have now constructed a beautiful model of the creature and confirmed it has the ability to survive into the next universe. While that's a long way off for us, we've unexpectedly got an entirely new armor structure that's clearly usable in warfare."
 sic_mod.176.name: "$tech_enigmatic_code_creation$"
 sic_mod.176.desc: "It's embarrassing that the way we've been looking for a way to survive the Big Crunch seems to have been... found in the dragon. It seems that we do not need to continue to spend time on this."
 sic_mod.180.name: "Crystal Coating Research"
 sic_mod.180.desc: "After discovering the rare crystal, our scientists have been looking for the possibility of using it directly to enhance the ship's hull, but have found nothing. Only recently, after we completely changed our scientific thinking, did we find a way to add it to the hull tissue."
 sic_mod.181.name: "Crystal Coating Research"
 sic_mod.181.desc: "Our scientists have carried out an in-depth study of the crystal composite coating and found that it can be further improved. If we use special methods to directly add rare crystals during the forging process (rather than simply adding crystals after forging), the resulting hull tissue will be able to take more damage."
 sic_mod.182.name: "Nanite Repair System"
 sic_mod.182.desc: "Our scientific team recently attempted to combine regenerative hull tissue technology with nanorobotics, and thus designed a prototype of a "Nanite Repair System". More research is needed on the mass production of this system, but preliminary tests show that it is far more efficient than traditional silicon bacteria based hull regeneration techniques."
