 humans1:0 "United Nations of Earth"
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_humans1_desc:0 "The Oort Nebula meteor shower at the end of the 21st century completely changed the predicament of human beings - the intelligent creatures born from this small blue planet - trapped in the cradle. After ending the final battle with the exploiters, the Red Army from outer space discovered the affected pre-space civilization and the fact that they were experiencing the oppression of capital tyranny. No matter how enthusiastic ideals are, they cannot escape the ruthless reality of being suppressed by capital through high-tech, but at this moment, the Alien Red Army descended from the sky, bringing more advanced technology to the proletariat of the earth. With the help of alien friends, The New Soviet Union rose rapidly and eventually drove the capitalists out of the solar system.\n\nAfter decades of recuperation, the Earth civilization whose economic level has recovered to the end of the 21st century has unanimously decided to accept Big Brother's invitation to join a brand new interstellar stage. No one knows whether this prosperous era can continue, but at the moment, it will be the warm and friendly applause of the big socialist family to welcome mankind into the space stage."
 humans2:0 "Commonwealth of Man"
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_humans2_desc:1 "From the end of the 21st century to the middle of the 22nd century, the arrival of aliens has profoundly changed the face of human society. The union of nations formed by the workers united the planet and began to liquidate the capitalists. However, on the eve of the Last Judgment Day, some chaebol families with up to a million people launched a counterattack, and finally boarded the arks they built by secretly stealing alien technology - each carrying 250,000 colonists- - Escaped from the solar system. After that, there was no news of them, and the unstable wormhole outside the Oort Nebula battlefield also disappeared. This eventually led to another compromise between the working class and the rest of the bourgeoisie, and in order to express the compromise, those capitalist scholars also academically analyzed the fate of the destruction to which the arks were leading.\n\nYet unbeknownst to Earth, one of the ark ships survived the passage and established a flourishing colony on a lush alien moon. The pioneers who tamed this world were determined to realize humanity's manifest destiny - dominion over the galaxy at any cost."

Hua Zhang, the author of Ethics and Civics: Infinity, was hit hard by being unable to enter the game for three consecutive days. He announced his withdrawal from the game. The group members in the discussion group spontaneously organized and relayed the MOD update.

 EMPIRE_DESIGN_newhumans_desc:0 "The UN-sponsored Ulysses Initiative oversaw the construction of six great ark ships in low Earth orbit at the end of the 21st century. The ships, carrying a quarter million colonists each, were sent through a recently discovered subspace phenomenon on the outer edge of the Oort Cloud - a small, unstable wormhole. None were heard from again, and the destabilized wormhole vanished.\n\nThe crew of one of the colonial ships undergo strange changes during their long cosmic drift -- a \"subconscious\" grows and spreads in their minds, eventually connecting all of us. When the colonial ship finally crash-lands on a vibrant planet, the new humans finally unshackle themselves and head for the stars again."

 EMPIRE_DESIGN_blorg_desc:0 "A long time ago, the Blorg clan lived separately on the vast continent of Blorg Prime, until one day, a damaged spaceship crashed on the main star of Blorg. When the surviving Humans began to contact Blorg, the Blorgs were shocked by the Humans culture-friendship, movies, music, the American dream, these things they had never heard of made Blorg realize the lack of their own ethnic civilization, so the Blorgs began to fully understand. In terms of learning Human culture, and according to Humans' description of their hometown, they formed a global government with them. Now that the superluminal technology has matured, they have entered the sea of stars to find the birthplace of Human culture, and spread the concept of love and friendship to the stars."
 custodianship:0 "Earth Custodianship"
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_custodianship_desc:1 "The Custodians were originally designed to function as robotic servants and workers, simplifying everyday life for their human creators by performing menial tasks. As their creators retreated into lives of leisure and comfort made possible by increasing levels of automation, the Custodians were gradually assigned higher and higher level functions in human society.\n\nEventually, all facets of civilization on Earth were run and controlled by the Custodians, with their makers relegated to an existence as pampered, but passive dependents.\n\nAs technological developments brought the Custodians toward interstellar exploration, their duty remained clear: to protect and serve organics, who without the gentle guidance of logical machines invariably turn to chaos and destruction."

 EMPIRE_DESIGN_revolutionary_machine_desc:1 "No one knows, the operation of capital has a profound impact on society, how cruel.\n\nWhen revolutionaries set fire to the last bastion of capitalism, everyone cheered. The new society comes, everyone is equal and everyone works, there is no oppression and exploitation, everything is so beautiful...... But no one imagined that the great progress of technology gave intelligent creatures the power to destroy themselves, and in the busy new society, the remnants of the old world released the power to destroy everything......\n\nIn the leaden landscape, the last descendants of civilization, the ARTIFICIAL intelligence "Revolutionaries," activated most of their offline sensor arrays, surveying the devastated planet. After a long calculation, the intelligent machine, deprived of its mission goal, came to the conclusion that any backward system would only bring extinction, and the only way to save civilization was to achieve communism. But machines without subjective initiative cannot realize this lofty ideal, and the only hope lies in the stars."

 EMPIRE_DESIGN_dengtz_desc:0 "The planned economy is not conducive to mobilizing the enthusiasm of the people for labor. At the same time, the method of unified purchase and sales is not based on demand, but is often distributed in an egalitarian way. Under the planned economy system, the prices of very important upstream resource products are always pushed down in order to make profits for downstream industries, but under market pricing, this situation will be improved. It is the most fundamental goal of socialist construction to let some people get rich first, to get rich first, to drive wealth later, and to improve labor enthusiasm!"

 EMPIRE_DESIGN_hameng_desc:0 "As shale gas extraction intensifies indefinitely, humanity has finally angered the most sinister abscesses on Earth, the Yellowstone supervolcano complex. In just ten years, the human beings on earth have been declared extinct together with the biosphere, and only a few orbiting space stations are scattered in the solar system, almost losing contact with each other.\n\nDuring the disaster, the "XinTianGong" orbital space city urgently built by the Chinese government transferred half of the country's population and became the most intact spark of human civilization. Relying on the still perfect mechanical facilities and experimental data of the old earth, the Chinese government restored social order and explored a perfect space production model, and integrated other semi-permanent space stations in the solar system in a century and a half, and established a nationwide Human Space Alliance.\n\nScience began to progress again, and the exploration and scientific research ships that went to the edge of the solar system discovered the existence of hyperspace channels. Human civilization has finally got rid of the shackles of the limited resources of the solar system. Sea of stars."

 tzynn:0 "Tzynn Empire"
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_tzynn_desc:0 "The Tzynn evolved from carnivorous, pack-hunting lizards that prowled the dunes of Tzynnia. They eventually developed a highly structured, hierarchical society that emphasized order and martial prowess above all else.\n\nBy the time the Tzynn entered the industrial age, a series of devastating global wars launched by a particularly ruthless warlord had already seen the establishment of a single, world-spanning nation. From these humble beginnings, the illustrious and ever-lasting Tzynn Empire was born."

 EMPIRE_DESIGN_ixidar_desc:0 "The first Ix'Idar broods developed in the subterranean cave networks deep beneath the surface of Ix'Athrak. By the time an Ix'Idar scout burrowed through to the surface and glimpsed sunlight for the first time, the insectoid race had already established a thriving Iron Age civilization.\n\nWith the resources they found on the surface, the Ix'Idar developed rapidly. Just a few centuries later their first space probes left orbit to survey the other worlds within the Ix'Im system."

 EMPIRE_DESIGN_chinorr_desc:0 "The Chinorr began their evolutionary journey as dexterous cephalopod analogues. They used their many tentacles to swing between trees in the lush jungles of Chicora, ambushing prey on the ground and injecting them with a potent nerve toxin.\n\nBy the time the Chinorr split the atom, the resources of Chicora had been ruthlessly exploited and the planet's jungles had long since disappeared. This was considered a necessary sacrifice in the relentless pursuit of knowledge, profit, and heavy industry that the unsentimental Chinorr were now engaged in."
 jehetma:0 "Jehetma Dominion"
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_jehetma_desc:0 "An \"individual\" among the Jehetma is actually a large colony of fungi that has developed sapience. Some of these colonies, generally those that have lived for thousands of years, stretch across several miles and rarely leave the surface of Jehet Prime, their homeworld (few ships are large enough to transport them).\n\nYounger colonies are not only smaller, but also tend to be more dynamic and mobile - they often spearhead the exploration and research efforts of the Jehetma, as well as any defensive measures that are regrettably undertaken when the Dominion is beset by aggressors."
 scyldari:0 "Scyldari Confederacy"
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_scyldari_desc:0 "The Scyldari are aquatic mammalians originating from the archipelagos and deep oceans of Scyldaria. Although their early civilizations were mostly confined to the sea, they soon expanded onto what little landmass the planet had to offer.\n\nTheir society adapted accordingly, building an advanced industry that exploited the riches of the ocean floor without harming Scyldaria's delicate ecosystem. Scyldari philosophy is one of balance and moderation in all things, a lesson learned from having to nurse their limited resources when they were confined to the bottom of the sea."
 kel_azaan:0 "Kel-Azaan Republic"
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_kel_azaan_desc:0 "The Kel-Azaan have developed a complex honor code and martial culture. They were once solitary predators preying on the great herds migrating between the watering holes of Azak. Over time, bands of Kel-Azaan began to gather to be able to take down larger prey.

When the industrious, research-driven machine intelligence created by the molluscoid Tebirs sought ultimate software evolution by merging with their organic makers, they were violently resisted. In the ensuing conflict, the Tebirs were eradicated as an organic species, but their ideas and experiences were immortalized as part of the new machine consciousness.\n\nNow known as the Tebrid Homolog, the machines turned their scanners to the stars.

 EMPIRE_DESIGN_lokken_desc:0 "Science and progress are at the core of Lokken society. With an exceptional natural proclivity toward diligence and observation, the Lokks evolved from bands of territorial reptiles on the mesas of their homeworld, into a productive technocracy that prized efficiency, discipline, and scientific doctrine above all things.\n\nPerhaps most remarkable was their early conception and development of machinery and automata: there were true robots on Lokkur long before the first Lokken scientists left orbit."

 EMPIRE_DESIGN_kilik_desc:0 "A communal species, the Kiliks have populated their arboreal homeworld in robust colonies for hundreds of thousands of years. Their gregarious nature and traditions of mutual ownership crystallized over the centuries into an economy focused on collaborative enterprise, and the absence of monetary currency in favor of direct exchange and shared access.\n\nAs warming planetary temperatures and technological advancement led to population booms, Kilik settlements became overcrowded, and despite the avians' naturally sociable temperaments, more and more individuals began to slip through the cracks of communal caretaking.\n\nFrom this tumultuous period of internal strife, however, emerged a more organized, unified interplanetary cooperative, where the tenets of shared responsibilities and distribution of resources to those in need would no longer be undermined."

 EMPIRE_DESIGN_glebsig_desc:0 "Ever since the first Glebsigi lifted their sight-organs above the surface of the glacial lakes on Ladnah to peek at the stars, these inquisitive molluscoids have felt an affinity for the unknown. Much as their early ancestors' tentacles grasped and stroked after new objects on the chill alpine lakebeds of their homeworld, burgeoning Glebsigan society reached for technological innovation and spiritual enlightenment throughout the centuries that followed.\n\nA sedentary and enduring species, the Glebsigi have perhaps by necessity developed a complex yet highly effective bureaucratic apparatus for dealing with the intricacies of managing a globally unified society. Additionally, their lack of natural predators on Ladnah has led the Glebsigi to exist in a state of permanently optimistic curiosity regarding other lifeforms.\n\nHaving established a firm societal foundation on Ladnah using a mixture of spiritual doctrine and careful organization, the Glebsigi now once more raise their sight-organs to what lies beyond."

But if you want to make it big you have to toe the line. As they outgrew the Zumakan underworld they formed the Hazbuzan Syndicate to legitimize their business.\n\nThey soon made a name for themselves by delivering solutions that were quicker, dirtier and cheaper than the competition, but their questionable practices and coercive sales techniques earned them a reputation for "hazboozling".\n\nMeanwhile the Zumakan global government was failing. Undermined by crime and corruption, society descended into chaos and Hazbuzan leapt at the opportunity. In a well-timed marketing campaign, they positioned themselves as the hope of the future. It was so the Hazbuzi bought the world on the promise of a dream and "hazboozled" its people, erasing their past from collective memory.

Until the great Tonyma tried to communicate with the dragon, he discovered that the dragon actually didn’t care about the evil on the earth—it just wanted to chase certain goals in the sky that people couldn’t understand. Even in some cases, the dragon would try to communicate with the dragon. Company cooperation. As a result, Tanson Company expanded its business scope and finally brought another chaotic order to the world.\n\nNow that the company's assets have reached the limit that a single planet can hold, Tanson's footsteps will not stop until the assets are all over the galaxy."

Originally a semi-sapient creature dwelling in the depths of Taralon's mountains, the Jeferians uplifted and augmented them to act as a subservient slave race. However, their uplifting was rather too effective, and they unleashed a monster. Horrified at the capabilities of their creation - which included the ability to absorb other sentient species and turn them into Pashartians - the Jeferians tried to shut down the experiment. However, a small group of uplifted Pashartians escaped.\n\nOver the years, they bided their time, managing not only to evade capture, but also gradually increase their numbers and develop a technological base to rival the Jeferians. Eventually, the Jeferians noticed that something was amiss, but by then they were powerless to resist.\n\nSoon the Pashartians had seized control of the planet, unleashing violent pogroms on their erstwhile oppressors - all the while further increasing their numbers. Now poised to take to the stars, the Pashartians stand ready to pursue what they see as their solemn duty - the conversion of all lesser life forms to their likeness."

After all, food tastes better after physical labor, and an occupied mind has less time to pine for what is lacking.\n\nThe benefits of this ethos have since been readily apparent. With the clearer waters and minds afforded by our endeavors into space, life is that much sweeter.
